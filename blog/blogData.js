	@tags meta dev
	You can make blogposts like this. The date is the current unix time, in milliseconds.
	This can be found by running the following command in the console:
	<code>blog.timestamp</code>
	
	@p
	@tags html
	As you can see in the previous example, you can use html tags like <code>.

	@p
	You don't need to include tags anywhere, they're always optional (this paragraph is an example)

	@p
	@tags tag_with_spaces
	Although spaces separate tags, you can have spaces in a tag by using the underscore character (_)

	@p
	@tags language nerd
	Because I am a language nerd, this blog.js script of course comes with builtin corpus analysis tools,
	available through the console via <code>blog.corpus</code>

	@p
	I think that covers everything?
