@tags meta dev
You can make blogposts like this. The date is the current unix time, in milliseconds.
This can be found by running the following command in the console:
<code>blog.timestamp</code>

@p
@tags html
As you can see in the previous example, you can use html tags like &lt;code>.
Likewise you can also include images like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/Tabby_Kitten_on_Blue_Throw.jpg" alt="Tabby kitten on a blue blanket" width="300">
And bullet lists:
<ul>
    <li>Unordered task</li>
    <li>Another unordered task</li>
</ul>
Ordered lists:
<ol>
    <li>First task</li>
    <li>Second task</li>
</ol>
etc

@p
You don't need to include tags anywhere, they're always optional (this paragraph is an example)

@p
@tags tag_with_spaces
Although spaces separate tags, you can have spaces in a tag by using the underscore character (_)

@p
@tags language nerd
Because I am a language nerd, this blog.js script of course comes with builtin corpus analysis tools,
available through the console via <code>blog.corpus</code>
