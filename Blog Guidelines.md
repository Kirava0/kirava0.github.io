General guidelines for the blog, you must have a very very good reason to break them: 

Every article must reinforce at least one (or more) of the following themes.
 - Arguing in favor of the six points.
 - Pushing back against and exposing the fake competence and gaslighting of our worlds elites. 
 - Putting the spotlight on the damage caused by the greed, corruption, incompetence, and cruelty of the powerful. 
 - Giving voice to those who have been harmed by the above. 

Things to avoid: 
* **Any partisan label** outside of Radical Centrism itself. 
* Any unnecessarily divisive topics. Particularly topics used as wedge issues by elites. 

General Style:
Two kinds of articles, informative and argumentative. 

* Informative Articles.
	* Exist to inform people on issues, and generally build awareness.
	* Are intended for mass audiences under the assumption they could have zero existing sympathy for our movement.
	* Should be largely informative for the vast majority of the body text. These aren't argumentative essays, they should present the viewer information in a convincing fashion.
	* The most essential piece: **The information presented in the article should be sufficient on it's own to make people more sympathetic to our goals.** It is about exposing reality and letting people draw their own conclusions, not about trying to force their minds to change.
	* Only at the very end, should any push be made to move people towards the Six Points or our movement. This should be soft, IE: a brief explanation of several measures that can be taken to address that harm. Or a paragraph explaining why this issue is systemic, and cannot be solved with the modest reforms someone else is proposing. 

* Argumentative Articles 
	* These are more standard political opinion pieces.
	* Intended for a smaller audience of people already partially sympathetic to our movement.
	* Generally have these goals
	* 1) Make them believe even more in the movement.
	* 2) Push them from being passive supporters, to being more active supporters (activity generates change, not opinion). 
	* Generally read more like standard political posts.
	* Ideally end with a specific call to action. It's best if it's something they can do right now. 
	* (I've read research that calls to action work best if you give EXACTLY one. Giving a list of multiple apparently is ineffective. So let's do that for now.)
